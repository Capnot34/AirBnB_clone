## Description

This project aims to deploy a simple clone of the AirBnB website - a complete web application that includes a database, a web server, web pages with dynamic content, an API, and a command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface.

For the first step, we have built a command interpreter which is the first step to build the full web application.
